As [Navigation Drawer](https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/nav-drawer.html) says.

The navigation drawer is a panel that displays the gameâ€™s main navigation options on the left edge of the screen. It is hidden most of the time, but is revealed when the user swipes a finger from the left edge of the screen or, while at the top level of the game, the player touches specific icon actor.
